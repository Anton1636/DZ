    <p><h2>Linear Equations</h2></p>
    <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
    <p><h4 align=center>ax + b = 0  </h4></p>
    <p>where <b>a</b> and <b>b</b> are real numbers and <b>x</b> is a variable. 
       This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation. 
       Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. 
       Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b> so donâ€™t get too locked into always seeing an <b>x</b> there.
    </p>
    <p><h2>Quadratic Equation</h2></p>
    <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
    <p><h4 align=center>ax&sup2; + bx + c = 0  </h4></p>
    <p>where <b>a, b, c</b> are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).
       Also, <b>a</b> can't be 0.
    </p>
    <p><h2>The area of a circle (A)</h2></p>
    <p><b>&pi;</b> (Pi) times the radius (<b>r</b>) squared:</p>
    <p><h4 align=center>A = &pi; &times; r&sup2;  </h4></p>
    <p>or, when you know the diameter (<b>D</b>):</p>
    <p><h4 align=center>A = (&pi; / 4) &times; D&sup2;</h4></p>
    <p>or, when you know the circumference (<b>C</b>):</p>
    <p><h4 align=center>A = C&sup2; / 4 &times; &pi; </h4></p>
    <p><h2>Intersection</h2></p>
    <p>The intersection of two sets <b>A</b> and <b>B</b>, denoted by A &cup; B, 
       is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
    </p>
    <p><h4 align=center>A &cup; B = { x : x &#8714; A and x &#8714; B } </h4></p>
    <p>That is, <b>x</b> is an element of the intersection A &cup; B if and only if x is both an element of <b>A</b>> and an element of <b>B</b>>.</p>
